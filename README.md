# Favourite Grapes - https://lucyrush.github.io/milestone1/
Favourite Grapes is one of Dublin’s first wine bars and tasting rooms. It is a standing room dedicated to inspiring and educating people on delicious wines.
Ireland is currently undergoing a culinary revolution, with a growing cosmopolitan population and it’s increasing emphasis on quality over quantity. Dublin, Ireland’s capital, is the perfect place for the wine bar. 
The aim of this site is to introduce users to the new wine bar and show users the beauty of sustainable, ethically sourced, artisan wines and the pure joy of discovering ‘that-wine’ that pairs well with everything. 

## UX

- Explain what we do at the bar, making it known that the user needs to book a wine tasting and that walk-ins are also on option to plan their visit

Make it easy for the user to contact us should they wish to book a tasting

### Target Audience

The marketing for Favourite Grapes would be targeted and men and women who are looking to learn more about wines while enjoying a wine of their choice. The audience will be aged between 21-55, earning well and likely regular restaurant patrons. The patrons would typically be social, stylish and interested in the night-life of a capital city. 

## Strategy

My goal of this site is to create a simple, visually appealing website to help new and experienced wine lovers discover sustainable and ethically sourced wine from all over the world in one location with a four-page static site. 

## Scope

To provide potential customers with information on the wine bar, a description on what is done, including tastings and buying wine per glass, a list of the available wines to taste and the best way to contact the wine bar.

## Structure

The main structure of this website involves 4 pages, the landing page, the What We Do page, the Our Favourites page and the Contact Us page. 

The navbar is not fixed to the top and appears first for all four pages. The Logo (Favourite Grapes) and the slogan (wine bar and tasting room) is also a link to the Home page. On smaller screens, the navbar collapses using Bootstrap, to a horizontally stacked menu, keeping the same font and background colour as on larger screens.

The pages will all include the same heading and footer. Each of the pages have large text, reminding the user which page they are on. The large text is the same as the Nav bar text items. The second heading is slightly smaller than the main page heading. This line gives the user a little more information on what they can expect from the page that they have visited. The smaller text is information on the bar which either gives the user a better understanding of the bar, the current list of wines or how to contact the bar. 

The footer of each page is the same. The footer includes the opening hours and days. The footer also links the different social medias, making it easy for the user to stay informed about all news and events the bar publishes. The ‘Make A Reservation’ button will direct the user to the ‘Contact Us’ page, which speeds up the reservation process for the user. 

## Skeleton

This website is static and is composed of four pages.

Each of the pages are simply styled with images taking up most of the real estate on the pages. The heading and the footer are the same throughout the pages of the site. 

These are the wireframes, which include both the desktop and mobile view for each section:
