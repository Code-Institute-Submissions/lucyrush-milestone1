# Favourite Grapes - https://lucyrush.github.io/milestone1/
Favourite Grapes is one of Dublin’s first wine bars and tasting rooms. It is a standing room dedicated to inspiring and educating people on delicious wines.
Ireland is currently undergoing a culinary revolution, with a growing cosmopolitan population and it’s increasing emphasis on quality over quantity. Dublin, Ireland’s capital, is the perfect place for the wine bar. 
The aim of this site is to introduce users to the new wine bar and show users the beauty of sustainable, ethically sourced, artisan wines and the pure joy of discovering ‘that-wine’ that pairs well with everything.
